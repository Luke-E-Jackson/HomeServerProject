Documenting my process of setting up a home server

I've started the process of building a cybersecurity homelab, and the first thing I'm doing is setting up a home server. I'm using an old hp laptop with Ubuntu Server LTS as the server.
I'm currently Configuring everything and should have it up and running tomorrow.
