# HomeServerProject
Documenting my process of setting up a home server

I've started the process of building a cybersecurity homelab, and the first thing I'm doing is setting up a home server. I'm using an old hp laptop with Ubuntu Server LTS as the server.
I'm currently Configuring everything and should have it up and running tomorrow.

Going to add Wireguard VPN and Wake-On-Lan to be able to access the server from anywhere.

I'll document the process on this github project to be able to showcase it on my portfolio website.
